Before we give instructions on how to get this interface working, [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zithwyawy7kukfe/full_corpus_demo_2.mov?dl=0) is a quick **demo** on how to use the interface/corpus.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repo to you computer using `git clone https://github.ubc.ca/amlk8913/SH_VT_AL_public.git`.


2. Open your `Terminal` and go to the directory where this repo is cloned and type `python corpus_backend.py`.


3. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:9996/`.


### Things to Try

1. In the `Results Type` section, if you just click on `Bar Chart` and then click on `Go!`, you will see the average rating of the four companies based on English, French and Chinese speakers.


2. If you just click on `Pie Chart` and then click on `Go!`, you will see customer sentiments for all four companies with options to view the customer sentiment for each company.


3. In the `Keyword Search`, you can search for a query and the tweets/Weibo posts that contain the query will be displayed based on the single or multiple `Language`, `Company` and/or `Sentiment` options you select.
